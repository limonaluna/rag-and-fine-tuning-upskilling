# Solutions for the Tasks from Journey 2

In this document you will find the solutions for the Tasks from Journey 2.

Let's have a look at the data of our search index and try to think how users might ask questions - and with which search query type the relevant chunks would be retrieved best!

1. Review content of the PerksPlus.pdf
2. Formulate two questions that users might ask about this content
3. Make assumptions about which search method will perform better (focus on keyword search vs. vector search)
4. Test the assumption by executing both searches and comparing the retrieved results.

  <summary>:white_check_mark: See Example Question 1!</summary>

    "Can I expense the fees of my soccer club?"

    üîç Assumption:
    - Keyword Search: May miss it unless "soccer" is explicitly mentioned (it's not).
    - Vector Search: Likely to succeed, since "sports team fees" is listed.

    Expected Outcome:
    ‚úÖ Vector search performs better
    ‚ùå Keyword search misses or ranks irrelevant results
